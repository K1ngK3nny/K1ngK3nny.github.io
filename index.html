      <p>My name is Kenneth Bledsoe and I'm a real estate professional and aspiring computer guru. Computer coding/programming and data visualization has sparked my learning 'flame'. Beyond that, I'm a proud husband and father and fitness enthusiast. I'm love jiu jitsu, weight lifting, hiking with my dog, and I dabble in yoga. I love to hunt and fish as much as I like computer gaming and programming. I guess you could say I like the best of both worlds! I'm no stranger to hard work and I like to problem solve. Check out my github profile for a look at more of my work. Anything real estate related, click on the professional website link.</p>
