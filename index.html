					<h1><span>About Me</span></h1>
					<p>
						Hey! I'm <strong>Kenny</strong>. Coding has changed my life. Learning to code has given me problem solving skills and a way to communicate with others on a technical level. I can also develop websites and use my coding skills for lots of things. And I learned it all at <strong>Sololearn</strong> where it's easy to learn coding and stay motivated.
